## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research.

**More than 70% of researches have tried and *failed* to reproduce another scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature's* survey of 1,536 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research
\

The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducible, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

### The survey
In the survey [^1] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibility in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

* Better understanding of statistics
* Better mentoring/supervision
* More robust design
* Better teaching
* More within-lab validation
* Incentives for better practice
* Incentives for formal reproduction
* More external-lab validation
* More time for mentoring
* Journals enforcing standards
* More time checking notebooks

### make an ordered list
1. first item
    a. item 1a
        i. item 1ai
        ii. item 1aii
2. second item
3. third item

### make an unordered list
* item 1
* item 2
    * item2a
        * item2a 
        
## checked items 
- [ ]  unchecked
- [x]  checked

## making a table

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| :------- | :------: |
| item 1,1 | item 1,2 |

## maing a block
``` 
print("Hello world")
x <- 1 + 2
print(x)
```
